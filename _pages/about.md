Hi! My name is Wayde Gilliam, and I'm the owner of [ohmeow.com](https://ohmeow.com).

In addition to being a full-stack web application and ML developer, I'm an active member in the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) community and a contributor to their deep learning framework.  I also have the privilege to mentor a number of High School students on a local FIRST Robotics FRC team in the ways of software development and analytics. 

I'm a strong advocate of the thoughtful reading of books (not on a piece of glass mind you ... the paper kind) and keeping a good work/life balance that promotes both intellectual and physical well-being (something I and most engineering type folks struggle with).  I can honestly think of few things better for us as human beings to be involved with than the reading books.  I'm not on most social media because I consider it a net negative to us as a species, however, you can find me on twitter where my account is primarily professional in nature or via e-mail.
