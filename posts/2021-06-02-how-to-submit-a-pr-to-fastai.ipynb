    "  The CLI makes it trivial to work on open source projects.  In particular, it really shines when making a PR as you'll see below.  Here's the link to the cli's[excellent documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/) which you'll likely be referring to again and again (so keep it handy).\n",

There are all kinds of cool things you can do using the github CLI including monitoring the status of your PRs and also fixing them (which you'll likely have to do when the base repo owners ask you to make changes of one sort or another).  It's all in the docs and it's all fairly straightforward!"
