    "These days, it goes by many names, but officially the \"workshop\" is known simply as <a href=\"https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning\" target=\"_blank\">\"Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers & Data Scientists\"</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially envisioned as a four-week course, it quickly evolved into something much more dynamic ‚Äî a conference brimming with talks, office hours, and a wealth of insights shared on their Discord. Participants also received a generous amount of credits from various companies in the field to experiment on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the event has technically concluded, I‚Äôm remain only 95% convinced that it‚Äôs truly over (a new \"30 minute\" 90 minute session could pop-up in my calendar at any moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "At it's core, the event is about equipping participants with the necessary tools and techniques to create a comprehensive pipeline for building generative NLP solutions, from dataset curation to deployment. Its spans 4 core workshops, 20 conference sessions, 6 office hours, and a bunch of async discussions via discord. If that sounds like a lot of content, good ... because it is! My friend Sanyam summed my feelings in week 3 with this message I got from him on Discord ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> Are you feeling overwhelemed by the course as well? I feel this is fastai by at 1000x speed ... but for real world, energy. It‚Äôs impossible for me to just keep up with the lectures, barely getting time to play with examples or run some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yah, to start, I want to share my thoughts on the major lessons learned and help folks figure out how to navigate and succeed in course/workshop/whatever of this scale. This is an opinionated take from someone who's been around awhile, but I hope an experienced take worth consideration.\n",

    "## Tip 1: Focus Your Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice is to **definitely watch the main conference workshops ... TWICE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how I do the fastai courses as well. I watch the lecture more as an active participant the first time, watching it live if possible, asking (and answering question), jotting down thoughts or other parts of the lecture I want to dive deeper into later. On my second watch, I usually have a \"printed\" version of the session notes/slides on my iPad that I annotate as I got through it again a bit slower. I usually do this 2nd watch a few days after to give my brain time to rest and reflect.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there I suggest **following the same approach with any conference talks you're interested in ... but only doing that 2nd watch for those you care about**. Honestly, I still haven't watched all of them myself and have been content to really spend time with those most close to the things I'm working with IRL and/or I want to learn (e.g., I've watched Ankur Goyal's talk on using BrainTrust about 3-4 times because I like the tool and I want to explore it as something I use in both my personal and professional life).\n",
    "\n",
    "As **for the office hours, I've tried to attend as many as I could and ask a lot of questions**. I don't watch these a 2nd time and I don't do a lot of detailed note taking except where something really lands as important or useful to me personally (like an answer to one of the really great questions that come up in these).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The like $3,500 in free credits is great, but for me, the real alpha of this course ... and the real bang for your buck ... is in the Discord. **Spend a lot of time there!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are literally able to interact with other practitioners and course instructors who charge serveral hundered dollars an hour as consultants for the same kind of expertise and guidance you get for your one-time payment of $500. For me, this puts the value of the course into the tens of thousands easily, making my call to signup easily one of the best decision I've made in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there is A LOT of content in the discord so my recommendation is to **focus on the channels dedicated to things you care about** vs. trying to read it all. Some of my favorites include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Workshops (all of them)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging Help / training-runs (lots of learning from folks like Zach Mueller and others via real fine-tuning attempts; very helpful)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging Help / axolotl\n",
    "\n",
    "- Talks / kylecorbitt_prompt_to_model\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Talks / jason_improving_rag\n",
