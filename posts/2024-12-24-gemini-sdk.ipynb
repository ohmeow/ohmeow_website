Well it looks like Google has finally heard our cries and as part of the Gemini 2.0 release, they've released a new unified SDK that both Gemini API and Vertex API users can use to build applications. This makes is super easy to bounce back-and-forth between the two API options without having to understand the nuances of two somewhat different SDKs and what might break when you switch between them.\n"
