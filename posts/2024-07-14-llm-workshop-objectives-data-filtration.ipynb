There are core tasks that I need to perform like machine translation and sentiment analysis, but I'd also like to build a system whereby a user can provide it their own tools focused on NLP and the system figure out how to use them correctly.\n"

I did this because I couldn't get good results by giving GPT several somewhat complex tools for it to use based on what the user asked. The tools would get called but the results weren't great. Evaluation has been left to the eyeballs of myself and other human data scientists, which of course isn't optimal either.\n",
