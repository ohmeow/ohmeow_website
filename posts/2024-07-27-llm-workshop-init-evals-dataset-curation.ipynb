    "\n",
    "> Unit tests for LLMs are assertions (like you would write in pytest). Unlike typical unit tests, you want to organize these assertions for use in places beyond unit tests, such as data cleaning and automatic retries (using the assertion error to course-correct) during model inference. The important part is that these assertions should run fast and cheaply as you develop your application so that you can run them every time your code changes. <img src=\"images/blog-20240603/hamel-icon.png\" alt=\"Hamel\" style=\"border-radius:30px;width:auto;height:25px;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "I really liked the definition <a href=\"https://x.com/ankrgyl\" target=\"\\_blank\">Ankur Goyal</a>'s provided in his conference talk on doing <a href=\"https://www.braintrust.dev/\" target=\"\\_blank\">LLM Eval For Text2SQL</a>. He says that a \"great eval\" is comprised of three componnents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some **data** to act on\n",
    "2. A **task** to perform with that data (e.g., \"I want you to take some input and generate some output\")\n",
    "3. One or more **scoring** functions that measure how well your task did the job\n",

    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why you should eval?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ankur provides 4 key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To understand whether an update you made is an improvement or a regression (is it easy to figure this out?)\n",
    "2. Drill down into good or bad examples (is it easy to get at them?)\n",
    "3. Diff specific examples vs. prior runs (is it easy to see how your current evals did against your last evals?)\n",
    "4. Avoid playing whack-a-mole (can you easily track and know what you broke and/or fixed as you develop)\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we iterate through our evaluation pipeline, that's what we'll do. At each step we'll grab some data, define a task, and configure a number of scoring functions. It's really that simple. That is an \"eval.\"\n",

    "2. They can also be general tests that aren't specific to any feature or scenario (e.g., the model returns valid JSON).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A mechanism to evaluate performance **via scoring functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A mechanism to look at our data and see where things are working well or not so well overall and with specific examples **via the Braintrust UI where we can look at overall runs and example-specific metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The ability to make modifications to our system and measure how well they improved things or not **via subsequent experiments and the ability to look at improvements and regressions on a case-by-case basis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The ability to curate datasets that can be used for better evals and fine tuning **via the ability to add the results of experiments to datasets that can be reviewed, corrected, and used for more complex evals and fine tunes**\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a big fan of the platform and encourage y'all to watch Ankur's talk from the workshop included below to learn more (I've already watched it 3x).\n",

    "Initially, I was planning on showing y'all a couple more iterations in the eval pipeline before I realized this post is already long as hell. Braintrust is an awesome tool and I want to do it justice, and so my next blog post will cover two more experiments I ran before moving on to generate a dataset for fine tuning. In particular, I'll cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to merge the \"golden dataset\" with more sampled data to build up our dataset along with better and more task specific scoring functions.\n",
    "- How to really \"look at the data\" and review both improvements and regressions on a case-by-case basis.\n",
    "- How to improve our prompts and tool definitions based on what we see and then see how things measure up by comparing results to previous runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, I know this was a lot but I hope it encourages you to adopt a \"evals first\" type of thinking and also to give Braintrust a go. If you made it this far, thanks for reading!\n"
