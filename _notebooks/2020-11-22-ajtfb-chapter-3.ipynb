If you don't, you're likely to only uncover critical problems much later than you would have before, and even worse, you're likely to not produce anything at all! In the world of deep learning there are a number of tools, that while helpful, can really get you so bogged down that you never deploy something usable (e.g., experiment tracking tools, hyperparameter optimization libraries, etc...). Also, remember that getting something in production is a different task from winning a kaggle competition, where the later may require use of some of those aforementioned tools and the ensembling of dozens of models. For production, something better than human is often good enough to get out there and through refactoring, improve."
