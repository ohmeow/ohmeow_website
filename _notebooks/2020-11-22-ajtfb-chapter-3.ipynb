        "If anything, this is a call to humility, self-examination, and thoughtful dialog. Though we are increasingly living in a polarized world where one is judged by what particular slogans they choose, what party they belong too, who they follow on Facebook, and so on, we have the choice to not be such human beings. But in my experience that is easier said than done. It's too easy to shout at, rather than talk with, the \"other\" side because we can in blissful ignorance continue believing we got it right without ever being challenged. It's hard to really reason out our world views and argue with those who don't agree. If we did, we have find we have more in common that imagined and make further progress as a society into figuring these things out ... things like right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice, and how we can get along with each other despite our differences.\n",

        "\n",

        "I think at the very least, we need to be forthright about our dataset as much as on model performance. That way, expectations can be managed and a confidence level assigned to the results.  A threshold perhaps that could trigger human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measurement bias\n",
        "\n",
        "> ... occurs when our models make mistakes because we are measuring the wrong thing, or measuring it the wrong way, or incorporating that measurement into the model inappropriately.\n",
        "\n",

Online discussions can influence our viewpoints, or alter the range of what we consider acceptable viewpoints. Humans are social animals, and as social animals, we are extremely influenced by the people around us. Increasingly, radicalization occurs in online environments; so influence is coming from people in the virtual space of online forums and social networks.\n",
