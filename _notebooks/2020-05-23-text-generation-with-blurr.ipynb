It might just ring a Christmas bell or two regarding a side who are reasonably capable of scoring but need some pointers on how to defend. That much was obvious here in a performance of numerous back-line errors that had to be redeemed by goals 85 minutes apart. Leading after four minutes through Harry Kane, Tottenham spent large swathes of what remained hanging on. Had Wilfried Bony made more of the space he was repeatedly afforded by Federico Fazio, this might have been a different result altogether. Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen celebrates scoring an 89th-minute winner at the Liberty Stadium against Swansea City. Tottenham's Harry Kane (left), Eriksen (centre) and Jan Vertonghen (right) celebrate their 89th-minute winner on Sunday. Christian Eriksen (left) scores a late winner for Tottenham Hotspur as they took all three points away from the Liberty Stadium. Swansea City's (from left) Ashley Williams, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng look devastated after conceding late on. Harry Kane clinches his first in celebration after putting Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 ahead against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Kane (centre) leaps above the Swansea defence to power a header into the back of the net in just the fourth minute of the game. The Tottenham forward clenches his fist in celebration and runs off into the corner after opening the scoring on Sunday. Kane (centre, obscured) is congratulated by team-mates after opening the scoring at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. Instead, Bony scored only once and Tottenham rode a Swansea storm until Christian Eriksen picked their pocket at the other end. As Swansea manager Garry Monk put it: ‘It would have been stopped in the second half if it was a boxing match.’ Pochettino, meanwhile, was asked if there was a Spanish phrase for ‘smash and grab’, but he didn’t understand the question. Instead he focused on the ‘positives’, which in this case meant a first win in three league games and a tribute to the team’s spirit. Certainly, there was no shortage of application from Tottenham’s players when the going got tough and that has not always been the case in this strange season.

Either way it has been a superb tournament so far for the Americans, who also beat Ghana 2-1 in their opening game, now Sportsmail takes a look at the men who have taken them this far in Brazil. Soccer stars: USA are on the verge of qualification to the last-16 of the World Cup. Tim Howard – Everton. Born: New Jersey, March 6, 1979 (35) Clubs: North Jersey Imperials, Metrostars, Manchester United, Everton. Education: Raised in North Brunswick, one of the USA’s most successful exports in fact spent his formative years as a midfield player, balancing his talent for soccer with his obsession with basketball. Howard, affectionately known as Timmy by those who know him, was a teenage sensation on the court. His basketball coach Eddie Breheney recently told CBS: ‘Timmy’s athletic ability as a high school student was really off the charts. His agility, his hand-eye coordination, his stamina and just his love and passion for the game.’ By the age of 15, though, Howard was in goal for the USA youth teams and emerged as the nation’s most exciting young player, wining the MLS goalkeeper of the year award in 2001 and then earning a move to Manchester United in 2003. Value: £3million. All smiles: Tim Howard acknowledges the US fans after their 2-2 draw with Portugal. Geoff Cameron – Stoke City. Born: Massachusetts, 07/11/1985 (28) Clubs: Rhode Island Stingrays, Houston Dynamo, Stoke City. Education: After emerging into the MLS draft from the University of Rhode Island, Cameron was plucked out by Houston Dynamo. The versatile Stoke defender, a hero for many young soccer fans in the States, recently reflected on the rise of the game in an interview with the Providence Journal: ‘In Europe, in South America, in Africa — just about everywhere else in the world — most kids grow up playing soccer,’ he said. ‘But there are so many other sports in America.

Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people, while an Air Algerie crash in Mali killed 116 and TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan killed a further 49 people. The remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies, governments or organisations. Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months. The all-time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of Aeroflot Flight 217, which killed 174 people in Russia, and Convair 990 Coronado, which claimed 155 lives in Spain. However this year's total death count of 1,212, including those presumed dead on board the missing Air Asia flight, marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the Second World War. Scroll down for videos. Deadly: The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,158 even before the Air Asia plane (pictured) vanished. Fatal: Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine (pictured) and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people. Surprising: Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949. 2014 has been a horrific year for Malaysia-based airlines, with 537 people dying on Malaysia Airlines planes, and a further 162 people missing and feared dead in this week's Air Asia incident. In total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board Malaysia-registered planes. In January a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents, while the same number of crashes in February killed 107.
