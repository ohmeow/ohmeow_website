### Hey there!

I'm a full stack web application and machine learning developer with well over 20 years in the business. In addition to being the author of [blurr](https://ohmeow.github.io/blurr/), a python library that enables fast.ai developers to train Hugging Face transformers for core NLP tasks, I'm also a proud [fast.ai community leader](https://forums.fast.ai/u/wgpubs/summary), where I'm active in both contributing to their deep learning library and helping folks out on the forums and discord. Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my two labradors, reading, working out, and above all else, learning.  Feel free to give me a follow on twitter or github if any of the above interests you.
